It should be emphasised that a certain degree of further harmonisation of Community policy on the radio spectrum is desirable for services and applications, in particular for services and applications with Community or European coverage, and that it is necessary to ensure that the Member States make applicable in the require d manner certain decisions of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)."

The aim of this Decision is to establish a policy and legal framework in the Community in order to ensure the coordination of policy approaches and, where appropriate, harmonise d conditions with regard to the availability and efficient use of the radio spectrum necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal market in Communi ty policy areas such as electronic communications, tran sport and research and development (R & D). 2. In order to meet this aim, this Decision establishes procedures in order to: (a) facilitate policy making with regard to the strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of radio spectrum in the Community taking into consideration inter alia economic, safety, health, public interest, freedom of expression, cultural, scientific, social and technical aspects of Community policies as well as the various interests of radio spectrum user communities with the aim of optimising the use of radio spectrum and of avoiding harmful interference; (b) ensure the effective implementation of radio spectrum policy in the Community, and in particular establish a L 108/4 24.4.2002 Official Journal of the European Communities EN general methodology to ensure harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum; (c) ensure the coordinated and timely provision of information concerning the allocation, availability and use of radio spectrum in the Community; (d) ensure the effective coordination of Community interests in international negotiations where radio spectrum use affects Community policies. 3. Activities pursued under this Decision shall take due account of the work of international organisations related to radio spectrum management, e.g. the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). 4. This Decision is without prejudice to measures taken at Community or national level, in compliance with Community law, to pursue general interest objectives, in particular relating to content regul ation and audio-visual policy, to the provisions of Directive 1999/5/EC and to the right of Member States to organise and use their radio spectrum for public order and public security purposes and defence.
